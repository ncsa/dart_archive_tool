The time to Develop parfu and the system resources to test and benchmark it on Blue Waters were supplied by the Blue Waters Sustained-Petascale Computing Project, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois. Blue Waters is a joint effort of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and its National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).

Testing parfu used the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) including resources Stampede 2 and Wrangler at TACC and Comet at SCSC through allocation "Testing And Development Allocation for Parfu Archive Tool" TG-ASC170008 used in 2017-2018.

A large part of the motivation for developing parfu and the data sets we have used for testing are courtesy of the NCSA Genomics Group. Thanks very much to Dr. Mainzer and the rest of the group for letting us use your work as our test set.
